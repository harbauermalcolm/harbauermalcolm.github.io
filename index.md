### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 is one of my favorite labs because we wrote a sandwich themed MadLib program that taught us how to take command line arguments. The program takes words from the user and puts them into a fill-in-the-blank sentence. In the second part of the lab we wrote a Blackjack game that also used command line arguments. This lab made an impact on me because it appealed heavily to my interest in food and games. 
 
* Lab 9 

    File Input and Output is one of the most interesting things we learned this semester, but it is also one of the most difficult concepts for me to understand. In lab 9, we used file i/o to make a secret number game. Secret.cc takes the secret number as a command line argument and stores it in a file. Game.cc takes the userâ€™s guess and checks the file to see if it matches the secret number. The first part of lab nine was also interesting and challenging because we learned how to filter the contents of a file by sorting all the five letter words from a list and outputting them to the terminal. 

* Lab 12 

    I think lab 12 is the most exciting lab that we did because it feels like magic to make a computer construct an image. It was easily the most challenging lab because of the math and physics required to make it work, but I was excited to learn how these concepts are applied to programming. This lab sparked an interest in computer graphics and might influence the career I pursue because I would love to work with more image processing.
